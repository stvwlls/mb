##Interior

The home has so many features that it is impossible to list them all. White oak flooring was installed throughout, except in the bathrooms where tile flooring was used. The bathrooms feature two soaking tubs, two custom tile showers, and two standard showers. Accent nickel gap wood walls were installed in some rooms. In the kitchen, we installed custom-built cabinets with partial overlay, featuring shaker style doors and dryer front and finished with four coats of lacquer. We poured custom concrete counter tops in place and installed Bertazzoni appliances, including a full gas six burner range, double wall mount ovens, an oversized fridge, and two dishwashers. We installed two sinks in the kitchen as well. All the closets, the den, the dining room, the mudroom, and the walk-in closet have custom cabinet grade built-ins. 

The foyer is one of the focal points of the home, featuring endless shaker paneling on the walls and a chair rail. We built a cat walk through the middle of the foyer to connect the two wings of the second floor. We constructed a large open concept staircase with custom made steel posts using a cable rail system. Windows in the foyer go from floor to ceiling and there are six large skylights.

##Systems

We installed two hybrid furnaces that are primarily powered by heat pumps and that provide both heating and cooling. The system is considered hybrid because it has a backup propane fired burner that will kick on in the winter during periods of extreme cold or in the event of heat pump failure. We installed a whole-house generator for the harsh weather that we have here in Maine. There are two laundry rooms, one on the first and one on the second floor. 

##Exterior

The exterior consists of pre-dipped eastern white cedar shingle trimmed with a simple trim package, resulting in a mixture of a modern and traditional feel. The windows are Pella. On the front, we built two custom box windows. We built spacious Alaskan yellow cedar decks in the rear connected by a gray stone patio. There are copper hips and red cedar shingle roofs in addition to a farmer porch entry with an eight foot fir door, mahogany decking, and a fir center bead ceiling, finishing off with a red cedar roof and copper drip cap.
