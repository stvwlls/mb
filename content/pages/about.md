Patrick Landers, Mindful Building owner and lead carpenter, answers frequent questions about the company.

__How long have you been in business?__

I have been self employed since 2003. I started off as P.L. Construction. Later I partnered with a dear friend, and we operated as LandMarx Construction from 2011 to 2017. At that point we parted ways and I started operating under the name Mindful Building, LLC.

__What is the most important aspect of your business to you?__

Hands down, efficiency. Efficiency is at the core of the entire process, from the moment I meet a client. The design process, the permit process, material purchase and ordering, and the structure of the project are all guided by the principle of efficiency. This ensures that the project is completed in the most intentional way possible.  

__What aspect of your business matters the most to you?__

Following through from start to finish. Many companies have a great start but a rush finish. We stay consistent throughout the project. We make sure the client feels totally satisfied at the end. We're not rushing to get to the next job.

__What aspect of your business do you enjoy the most?__

The hands-on building portion. Although I&rsquo;m good with people, I am introverted at heart and love the solitude of a job site with lots to keep my hands and mind busy. It's like working meditation.

__Why should I choose your company over your competitors?__

I really can&rsquo;t say why anyone should choose us over someone else. Southern Maine is full of amazing tradesmen and we are just some of many. I primarily want to be chosen by clients that feel there is alignment with our beliefs and approach.

__Where is your company based? What areas do you service?__

Our wood shop is in North Yarmouth. We service greater Portland and north, from Scarborough to Brunswick.

__How does the whole process work?__

In the initial stages, we offer free estimates, consulting, and design guidance. We work with draftsmen, engineers, and architects, but as a representative of the home owner, advocating for their needs and desires.

__How do you determine the cost of the project?__

Fifteen years' experience helps a lot. Estimating is a mix of good accounting and honestly looking at each job. We get estimates from all our subcontractors and suppliers, then determine our labor cost based on each job and its timeline. We do some portions of the estimate by the square footage.

__Where do you get your materials?__

We source locally as much as possible. We get 85-90% of our materials from Hammond Lumber. We use other lumber yards and suppliers in the area and sometimes online as needed.

__Do you subcontract some of your work? How do you select your subcontractors?__

Yes, we do subcontract. We subcontract plumbing, electrical, and a few other aspects of the job if it makes sense financially. On big builds, hiring a sheet rocker and insulation specialist just makes sense as it costs less and can be completed while other work is underway. I select my subs based on a mixture of factors, including fair pricing, friendliness, and skill. But most important is their ability to show up and complete tasks in an efficient way.

__How much will I be involved? How much information will you be sharing during the process?__

You will be involved a lot in the beginning. After we have the majority of the work figured out, we will be working mostly from the blueprints and from the job description on the estimate. We will give you homework throughout the project, making sure all your decisions are made in plenty of time for us to stay on track. I will not be providing daily or weekly reports, though. You are welcome to check on progress daily and weekly, but it's easier on the crew if we have the ability to stay focused on the project instead of needing to walk though each step as it happens. If you are out of state, we provide photos throughout the job so you can see the progress.

__What if I change my mind during the project?__

No problem! It happens on every job. We suggest telling us as soon as possible so that we can avoid any unnecessary expenses. But either way, if you change your mind, we can do anything you want within the current building code. If you remove items, you will not be charged unless we have already furnished the materials and labor, in which case you will be charged only for what has been completed and what it will cost to make the changes you want.

__It seems like you might not have completed my type of project yet. Can I trust you?__

This is rare for us these days as our combined experience exceeds 100 years. I have been in business for fifteen years and have done everything from small residential renovations and additions to custom homes, historic preservation, and timber frames. Returning to a statement I made previously, there are many great builders in Southern Maine. If you donâ€™t feel you can trust us, do us both a favor and hire someone else. We want your business, but more importantly we want your trust.

__Is your work guaranteed?__

Yes. Up to one year and in some reasonable cases longer. All materials are guaranteed by the supplier, not by Mindful Building.

__Do you offer any discounts?__

We offer discounts when projects are larger, or if we complete multiple projects at one time since set up and break down tasks are consolidated. We are very reasonable. If you have a budget and our estimate exceeds it, please let us know so that we can try to find ways that we can meet your budget.
